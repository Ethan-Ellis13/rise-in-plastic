      <b>Global plastic use has increased by more than 300% in the past 70 years. Why?</b>
      <br>
      The graph above shows the drastic increase of plastic consumption from 1950 to 2019. As manufacturers find more effiecient and cheaper ways to make products, the harder it is to keep our earth clean. Plastic gets thrown into the sea, left on the streets, and takes years, even decades to break down. Over time, we see use in plastic continue to grow and pollute our planet.

      <b>United States and China are the two biggest plastic users.</b>
      <br>
      U.S. and China are some of the biggest manufacturers. They produce more than 4 times the amount of plastic than any other country. We as citizens need to do better to protect the planet by encouraging country leaders to take steps towards fewer plastic use.

        <b>Big companies produce mass amounts of plastic each year.</b>
        <br>
        If you have ever eaten a candy bar, you have contributed to plastic consumption. From chocolate wrappers, to soda bottles, to even cigarettes, which contain tiny plastic fibers. Plastic is made by burning harmful fossil fuels which is a cause of global warming. Every day we contribute to plastic pollution by purchasing from these companies.
